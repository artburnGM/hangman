# hangman in python land
---

quick and simple python game put together as a learning exercize for codecademy

### how it plays

everyone knows "hangman" by now.

game starts with a menu that allows one to choose a topic...

```
enter a number for a topic:
  1  to select animals
  2  to select outerspace
  3  to select sports
  4  to select any word from these topics
  5  to select literally any english word
  6  to quit
```

...then the game begins

hangman.py requires internet to access the api used for the 5th "literally any english word" selection. 
It is crazy and this will be the the first time you've seen most words that it gives as an option.

that's about it.

Have fun not dying on a rope!
